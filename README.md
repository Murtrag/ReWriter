The "Speed Reading and Touch Typing Practice Tool" is a web application built
with React.js, Redux, HTML. It allows users to load any text of
their choice from their local drive and practice touch typing while reading a book.
The tool provides a distraction-free environment for focused practice and is
designed to help users improve their typing accuracy and speed. The application
features a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to upload their own
texts. Once a text is loaded, users can start typing the text on their keyboard while
reading it, relaxing and enjoying a good book.
